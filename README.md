#WORDLE

##About

**Wordle** is a game developed by software engineer Josh Wardle and published by The New York Times Company in October 2021. The game belongs to genre of puzzles. Player must guess the secret word in 5 or less attempts.

I implemented main idea of original Wordle in my study project based on React. Some features like UI settings were injected as an additional functional that can make the game more confortable.
